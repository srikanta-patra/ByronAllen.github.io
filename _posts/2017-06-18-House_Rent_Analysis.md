Off late I have been searching for a rented accommodation which should be close to school. This gave rise to an idea of trying out this data science project. 

Purpose of this project is to

1. Scrape www.realestate.com.au

2. Using Google API to find the coordinates of house.

3. Use NSW govt databases to load schools and their locations

4. Verify the trends in house prices based on its distance from the nearest school.

5. Use Machine Learning to Predict prices based on distance from school.
