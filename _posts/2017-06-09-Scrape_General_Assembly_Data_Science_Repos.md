title: Scrape Repo links from General Assembly Data Science Course
---
![_config.yml](http://sds.parsons.edu/elab/files/2015/08/GeneralAssembly_logo-300x101.png)

This project was developed to aid all my fellow classmates at General Assembly Data Science Course to easily download all the 
repos stored in General Assembly's repo. This helped everyone download all latest repos to their local system before the access 
was stopped after the end of the course.

The code will scrape all available class lessons repo for DSI-SYD-2 git hub area and out put a git clone command for each link.

You can copy the links and put into a file e.g. all_DSI_repo.sh (with bash shell #!/bin/bash at the beginning of the file)

Run the command 'chmod u+x yourfilename.sh'

Execute the sh file from a terminal ./yourfilename.sh

This will clone all the repos in the current directory.
